WELCOME to the Landing Page Project!

The objective of the initial iteraitions of this project is to replicate a web page that the team of The Odin Project have provided! 

I will be using 2 source images to begin this project. One source image is the webpage that I will be replicating, the second source image will contain fonts and colors to use in the webpage. 

As I continue this course of programming, this project may see future iterations where it becomes more of my own for my own portfolio. Until then, this project will be a practice in taking what I see and putting it into a blank code.
